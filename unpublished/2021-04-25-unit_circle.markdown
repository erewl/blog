A circle can be described in terms of a radius r and the coordinates of the origin (x|y).
Given the line r, having the length of the radius and an angle a, we can describe any point on a circle
Visualising this, we can create a right-angled triangle with a hypothenuse of length r (given) and the other two sides being desccribed as x and y. Combining x and y together we get the coordinate Px|Py.
Luckily a right-angled triangle adheres to the Law of Pythagoras a2 + b2 = c2, or if we use our chosen variable names: x2 + y2 = r2
For now we have just considering the circle originating at 0|0. But if we want to use a different point of origin, we have to take the origin coordinates into account

(ox - x )2 + (oy - y)2 = r2
